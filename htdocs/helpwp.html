  <h3>Help</h3>
  <p class="hello">This page gives you some tips on how to cope with feeling depressed. Now, before that, who do people feel depressed? Well, there are several reasons on why people experience depression. It could be on their biology, or genes. It's also possible from past experiences, or because of the people arund the person. </p>
</div>

<div id="tip1" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Stay Connected With Others</h3>
  <p class="hello">Isolating yourself will not help ease your sadness. If you think that being with others won't help, then think again. People will help you in any way they can, if you ask. When you're all alone, it's difficult to help yourself. If you do really want no human interaction, try finding a pet to take care of. Caring for another life may help you care for your own. Perhaps a cute puppy? Or maybe a little hamster? Your pick.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip2" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Encourage Yourself to Act</h3>
  <p class="hello">Act as in, do things you normally want to do. Depression may prevent you from doing the things you normally love. So push yourself to do them, even if you don't want to. You may want to think of something that makes you want to. Anyway, doing what you love can greatly help you.</p> 
</div>

<div id="tip3" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Take Care of Your Health</h3>
  <p class="hello">Starving yourself because you don't want to eat won't do you any good. Remember to eat a healthy diet, and don't forget to eat. Take care of your everyday hygiene as well. Perhaps a nice, warm bath would remind you of the happy times you had? While you're at it, you might want to listen to some of your favorite music. Mos importantly, don't forget to get the right amount of sleep every night.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip4" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Go Out and Enjoy</h3>
  <p class="hello">Staying at home feels nice, but it gets old sometimes y'know? Why not step outside and enjoy the sun? Perhaps a little sroll in the park with you furry companion might help you feel better. You might also want to do a bit of cardio to forget all about all that sadness. If you're not feeling up to it, push yourself to do so. You'll thank yourself.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip5" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Stay Away From Negaivity</h3>
  <p class="hello">"I'm not good enough."<br><br>Yes you are. Why would you still be here then? Because you strive to be.<br><br>"I'm better off gone."<br><br>No you aren't. You're not better off dead. There are people who care for you. If not, find someone who will.<br><br>"I can't do it."<br><br>Yes you can. Push yourself to do so. Don't give up yet.<br><br>"People don't like me."<br><br> This mindset, or a similar one can be really bad for you. Don't think that you're the worst. Don't degrade yourself. People learn to like you, so in return, learn to clear this mindset.<br><br>You see, these are only a few examples. You need to look away from the negative side of things and think otherwise. This will help you with your thoughts.</p>
